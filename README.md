# CS4370 : Database Management
## Welcome everyone!

This will be our private repo for the rest of the semester. Very glad to have you all here!

If you've never used Github / Git before, don't panic! It's a learning curve at the beginning but I promise that you'll quickly pick it up!

On that note - I have provided a couple of resources that helped me when I first began...

## Git Tutorials

[The beginner's guide to contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/).

[Another newbie guide with lots of photos](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/git-and-github-a-beginners-guide-for-complete-newbies)

[A super cool interactive sandbox with tutorials for Git (useful for intermediate users too!)](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

## Other Stuff
If anyone has any issues - hit me up on the GroupMe. At some point, we should add a schedule to this ReadMe but that can come later... 
Looking forward to an enjoyable and productive semester!
Go team!

- Dave
